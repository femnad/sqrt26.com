Behold! Following zathurarc file makes [zathura][zathura] keybindings at least as comfortable as those of [MuPDF][mupdf], while also eliminating the need to press Shift altogether. Altogether!

    map d scroll half-down
    map u scroll half-up
    map . navigate next
    map , navigate previous
    map h adjust_window best-fit
    map w adjust_window width
    map s scroll page-top
    map a scroll page-bottom
