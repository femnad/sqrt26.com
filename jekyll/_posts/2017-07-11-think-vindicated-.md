- What is best in life my dear Conan person?
- To confirm your bias. To realize you were right all along. To gather evidence to support the case for everyone else's wrongness. I can you can see where I'm going with this.
- Yes, that is mighty good.

So I used a MacBook Pro as my workstation for the first time and for a period of six months. Previously, I've never shown interest in owning a MacBook and never worked with one for an extended period. I obviously was aware of the fact an increasing number developers do (used to?) prefer the Mac OS X environment to everything else available and the reasons for such a distribution of preference. So turns out that my bias/instinct/gut feeling/resistance/stubbornness against working on the Mac OS X was on point because of several shortcomings of Mac OS X when subjected to my workflow habits. So here's the yay, meh, and nah aspects of working on a Macbook.

Yay
===

* Alfred

    Alfred, the productivity app is really great with it's functionality of launcher, clipboard and snippet manager while being highly customizable.

* Dash

    Dash, the documentation browser, is a major boost of productivity, not just because of the curated list of docsets, but especially about the way it strives to provide a very streamlined and efficient workflow for browsing documentation.

* Command Key

    The command key is super useful for having application and global level shortcuts. I also liked how consistent it's usage among applications was, like Command-L always focusing the search box in an application.

* Hammerspoon

    Hammerspoon is a powerful and extensible automation tool. Now, that's really truth in advertising since it allows you interact with OS X via Lua scripting and a whole lot of modules. My use case for it implementing a more sane window manager which mimicked the Ratpoison/Stumpwm school of window managing.

Meh
===

* Hardware

    While obviously designed with high standards, I didn't care for that much. For some reason the aluminum unibody doesn't appeal to me. Also it fries your lower parts when you're doing resource intensive tasks with the machine on your lap.

Nay
===

* Non-changable Default Behaviour

Specially, the lack of native, customizable window managing options and the one-size-fits-all approach. What I hated with passion are:

- Unavoidable animation when switching to fullscreen (only mitigated to some degree by some accessibility options)
- No way to turn to turn off window decorations (only available per application basis, like iTerm)

* Not having a GNU userland

Well, maybe I'm to accustomed to working with GNU/Linux distributions but some things really bugged me to no end; like not having the third button paste everywhere (except in iTerm), no iproute2, the 'command lines first, commands last' approach of BSD userland tools.

* Not playing well with external displays

While the retina screen really looks cool, it doesn't play well with external displays, you know those non-4k, non display port, behind the times ones. I swear the fonts looked really weird on the display. And this is coming from someone who is content with the font rendering for Linux distros.


But this all doesn't mean that the Mac OS X way of working is no good. I've seeing people being crazy effective/happy/crazy with it. However, since Mac OS X is so opinionated, it will pose problems for some people if you go with the one-size-fits-all approach and have everyone working on Mac OS X instead of providing the ability for everyone to choose their own working environment.
