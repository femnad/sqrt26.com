      <description>If you are implementing a Fuse filesystem it&amp;rsquo;s easier, ever more than usual, to commit to making silly mistakes over and over again. Case in point; obviously any dirent structure shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have a name with a / in it. However that simple fact might not be apparent if you forget the fact that a filesystem is supposed to be hiearchical. And in that case the error you get isn&amp;rsquo;t very clear (at first):</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re lost again when trying to send handcrafted packages to a syslog server, right? Luckily, for Rsyslog, Rainer Gerhards is here to help with the debug format template:
http://blog.gerhards.net/2013/06/rsyslog-how-can-i-see-which-field.html
The link provides example usage of the template for the legacy configuration language, therefore allow me to specify it in the modern syntax (because what&amp;rsquo;s another minute when you&amp;rsquo;re six levels deep into yak shaving?):

      <description>Dear future me,
Please find the helpful screenshot below when (not if) you once again forget how to configure tmux colors. I know you&amp;rsquo;re not doing it for the eye candy but for telling apart different environments and something similarly productivity enhancing.
Here is the relevant bit again for easier reproducibility:

      <description>- What is best in life my dear Conan person?
- To confirm your bias. To realize you were right all along. To gather evidence to support the case for everyone else&amp;rsquo;s wrongness. I guess you can see where I&amp;rsquo;m going with this.
- Yes, that is mighty good.

      <description>So, you want enable router and NAT functionality for your Neutron installation so that anyone would be able to create and manage routers? This setup is described as self-service networks by the OpenStack documentation and requires you to have the router service_plugin enabled. So in the neutron.conf the line:
service_plugins = router  should be present. If the router functionality is not enabled you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to run the L3 agent correctly since the relevant RPC message queues won&amp;rsquo;t be usable:</description>

      <description>You may encounter the following error if you try to use python-novaclient (stable/mitaka version) to interact with nova (also stable/mitaka version):
$ nova list ERROR (AttributeError): &#39;unicode&#39; object has no attribute &#39;get&#39;  Specifically the versions are:
$ nova --version 3.3.2 $ nova-api --version 13.1.1  The culprit is this line from novaclient.exceptions
if hasattr(body, &#39;keys&#39;): error = body[list(body)[0]] message = error.get(&#39;message&#39;) details = error.get(&#39;details&#39;)  Which is in turn caused by a change in upstream WebOb.</description>

      <description>When you want to make use of event based meters (like vcpus) in your OpenStack Nova installation, make sure that the Nova compute service is telemetry enabled, i.e. its nova.conf has:
[DEFAULT] ... instance_usage_audit = True instance_usage_audit_period = hour notify_on_state_change = vm_and_task_state notification_driver = messagingv2  After performing this change you&amp;rsquo;ll have to restart the Ceilometer compute agent (which you can run with the ceilometer-polling --polling-namespaces compute command, by the way) and the Nova compute service.</description>

      <description>So, for same reason I had to reinstall my OpenStack development environment and like a sane person, I decided to go with a virtualenv installation. However I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to start nova-compute because it failed with the following error (output is from a EC2 instance where I was able to replicate the behaviour with a global pip installation):
2016-02-26 09:25:44.391 2188 CRITICAL nova [-] NoSuchOptError: no such option in group libvirt: rbd_user 2016-02-26 09:25:44.</description>

      <description>So, you are getting pretty good at leeching of gmane with the unsatiable straw (as in enabler of feeding?) that is tin. But, you must also be getting pretty tired of those prompts asking for what to do if there is an attached signature or the message is multipart. Also, while it was done with best intentions, setting a mailcap file for several extensions with empty viewers is a worst practice.</description>

      <description>So, you&amp;rsquo;re stalking some mailing lists on gmane via tin over NNTP? The following option might come in handy:
cache_overview_files=ON  When I say come in handy, I mean it will prevent countless wall-fists by not fetching 100k+ messages every time you mistakenly navigate to the next mailing list in your subscriptions.</description>

      <description>In order to access pages from your hosted Atlassion Confluence on GNU Emacs via confluence-el mode, the confluence-url variable should be set thusly (assuming it&amp;rsquo;s placed within custom-set-variables arguments):
 &#39;(confluence-url &amp;quot;https://&amp;lt;hosted-site&amp;gt;/wiki/rpc/xmlrpc&amp;quot;)  Where &amp;lt;hosted-site&amp;gt; is probably somewhere.atlassian.net. Or not. At least in my experience, 100% of the cases (actually a case) it was that way.</description>

      <description>Since no one is going to produce a keyboard which provides numerable keys within the range of the thumb, thus removing the need to leave the home row, allow me to somewhat remedy my misery by adding the following 7 lines to my .xmodmap file:
keycode 133 = Mode_switch Mode_switch keycode 31 = c C Left keycode 32 = r R Right keycode 45 = t T Down keycode 46 = n N Up keycode 44 = h H Home keycode 33 = l L End  keycode 133 is the start key located on the lower left of a TypeMatrix 2030 keyboard.</description>

How much effort has to be put to replicate that functionality? A simple Android app only for sharing URLs with desired synchees, a simple Firefox add-on for checking whether there are any new URLs fetch when a browser instance identified as synchee is created and a simple message queue on which browsers would authenticate and subscribe to incoming URLs.</description>

      <description>Was consistenly running into a minor annoyance when using tmux in different environments, which is; tmux stops to respond to the prefix key, only when after a detach and re-attach the prefix key is usable again. Suspected this was an obscure bug since there was no mention of a similar case anywhere on the Internet. Finally managed to track down the issue; somehow it took me months to realize this issue only occurs when trying to copy/paste something from tmux buffer into X clipboard with the following key bindings:</description>

      <description>To prevent instant waking after suspension when using pm-utils, add modules that need to be unloaded before suspension to /etc/pm/config.d/modules. Most likely candidates are: usb and ehci related modules and their dependencies. Check for dependencies by trying remove modules with rmmod &amp;lt;module&amp;gt;. Also remember to unload wifi related modules since they may have problems after resume, as mentioned here:
