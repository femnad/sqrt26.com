Today's Unmentionables:

* [Vultr][vultr] is great
* Can't compile [fish][fish] under FreeBSD 10 [Apparently needs gmake]
* Can't install jekyll as a user gem either (neither? as well?)
* Actually the last two don't matter that much but aimless complaining is better than a simple test post, right?

[fish]: http://fishshell.com/
